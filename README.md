# QPlumbob Android Application and Arduino LED Controller

## ABOUT:
The QPlumbob application and Arduino protype exists as proof of concept for learning the ins and outs of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication and QML mobile development.

## BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
### Qt Environment
The development envoronment consists of Qt Creator 4.13.0 using the Qt 5.15 framework. The application was built using the Android Clang (NDK 21.1) compiler packaged with Qt for Android 10. 

### Arduino Environment
The prototype environment uses version 1.8.13 of the Arduino IDE for the Arduino NANO IoT 33 device.

### Notes
After importing the project or upgrading Qt if there are problems building or running the application on Android, try deleting and recreating the Android Manifest file.
